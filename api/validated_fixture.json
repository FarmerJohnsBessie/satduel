The text indicates that scholars used to believe that during the Classic period, the Maya civilization didn\u2019t have agricultural marketplaces. According to the text, scholars held this view because they misunderstood the ecology of areas where the Maya lived. The text points out that people tend to create marketplaces in order to acquire resources they don\u2019t otherwise control. Agricultural marketplaces would have allowed farmers who produced one type of crop to trade that crop for other types of crops that they didn\u2019t produce. The text goes on to say, however, that scholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya areas, meaning that scholars thought that the Maya landscape produced a smaller range of resources than it actually produced. Taken together, then, this information suggests that scholars assumed that marketplaces wouldn\u2019t have allowed Maya people to acquire products different from the products they already produced: that is, if everyone produced the same array of crops, as scholars mistakenly believed, then there wouldn\u2019t have been any need for marketplaces where people could trade those crops."

            "question": "In 2014, Amelia Quon and her team at NASA set out to build a helicopter capable of flying on Mars. Because Mars\u2019s atmosphere is only one percent as dense as Earth\u2019s, the air of Mars would not provide enough resistance to the rotating blades of a standard helicopter for the aircraft to stay aloft. For five years, Quon\u2019s team tested designs in a lab that mimicked Mars\u2019s atmospheric conditions. The craft the team ultimately designed can fly on Mars because its blades are longer and rotate faster than those of a helicopter of the same size built for Earth.\n\nAccording to the text, why would a helicopter built for Earth be unable to fly on Mars?",
            "choice_a": "Because Mars and Earth have different atmospheric conditions",

In other words, a helicopter built for Earth can\u2019t fly on Mars because of the differences in the two planets\u2019 atmospheres."

            "explanation": "The question asks about a valid criticism of the experiment's design. Choice A is a valid criticism because a small sample size can make it difficult to generalize the results to a larger population. Choice C is a valid criticism because random assignment is essential for ensuring that the two groups are comparable at the start of the experiment. Choice D is a valid criticism because it is important to control for all potential confounding variables that could explain the results. Choice B is not a valid criticism because the experimenters cannot control for how engaging the participants find the videos. The purpose of the experiment is to test whether experiencing awe increases altruistic behavior, and it does not matter whether the videos are equally engaging."

Although the artist is depicted playing music, in the background, one can spot a painting easel by a window.\n\nBased on the texts above, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1?\n\nThe underlined claim states that Annibale Carracci was the first artist to depict himself as a painter. However, Text 2 provides evidence that Lavinia Fontana's painting, created in 1577, also depicts the artist as a painter, albeit indirectly. How would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the claim in Text 1?",
            "choice_a": "Carracci and Fontana were among the most well-respected painters in Bologna at the time.",
            "choice_b": "The depiction of Fontana in Self-Portrait at the Keyboard was intended to underscore the artist\u2019s creativity.",
            "choice_c": "Fontana likely inspired the reference to an easel and palette in Carracci\u2019s painting.",
            "choice_d": "Self-Portrait at the Keyboard was painted earlier than Carracci\u2019s painting and also refers to the artist\u2019s craft.",

Because of this, the critic argues, it is impossible to know whether the same programs would be as effective if they were scaled up to serve a larger population.\n\nWhich choice, if included in the essay, would most effectively address the critic\u2019s concern?\n\nWhich choice, if included in the essay, would most effectively address the critic\u2019s concern?",

Its history dates back to the 6th century BC when the Nabataeans, an Arab tribe, settled there. The Nabataeans used their knowledge of water management to create a sophisticated irrigation system, which allowed them to grow crops and raise animals in the desert. They also built elaborate temples and tombs, carved into the sheer rock faces of the surrounding mountains. Petra's architectural achievements are renowned for their beauty and ingenuity. In the 2nd century AD, Petra became part of the Roman Empire and continued to prosper as a trading hub. However, a series of earthquakes and the rise of sea trade led to its decline in the 6th century AD. Centuries later, Petra was rediscovered by European explorers in the 19th century and has since become a popular tourist destination.\n\nWhich of the following is NOT an advantage of Petra's irrigation system?",

In fact, nearly two-thirds of commuting students reported that financial reasons were their primary motivation for choosing to live at home while attending college. Furthermore, commuting students tend to have lower overall expenses than those who live on campus. For example, commuting students typically do not have to pay for room and board, which can be a significant expense for on-campus students. Additionally, commuting students often have the opportunity to work part-time jobs while attending school, which can help them to offset the cost of tuition and fees.\n\nBased on the information in the paragraph, which of the following is most likely to be a benefit of commuting to college?",

This\ncontext supports the idea that computer models simulate Earth\u2019s climate in the distant past.\nChoice A is incorrect because scientists use existing physical evidence as a basis for developing computer\nmodels that describe what Earth\u2019s actual past climate might have been like. The models are not being used to\n\u201cinvent,\u201d or imagine, a completely  ctional climate.

The text states that Suarez, P\u00e9rez-Huerta, and Harrell\u2019s research on mosasaur tooth enamel led them to conclude that mosasaurs were endothermic, which means that they could live in waters at many different temperatures and still maintain a stable body temperature. The researchers claim that endothermy enabled mosasaurs to live in relatively cold waters near the poles. If several mosasaur fossils have been found in areas that were near the poles during the period when mosasaurs were alive and fossils of nonendothermic marine mammals are rare in such locations, that would support the researchers\u2019 claim: it would show that mosasaurs inhabited polar waters but nonendothermic marine mammals tended not to, suggesting that endothermy may have been the characteristic that enabled mosasaurs to include polar waters in their range."

GMOs have drawn their share of criticism, however. Critics say GMOs could have unintended consequences for the environment and human health. Some critics also point to the fact that GMOs give corporations too much control of the food supply.\n\nA new study has found that GMOs may not be as harmful as critics claim. The study, which was published in the journal Nature, found that GMOs do not pose a significant risk to human health or the environment. The study also found that GMOs do not give corporations too much control of the food supply.\n\nThe study\u2019s findings are likely to add to the debate over GMOs. Critics of GMOs are likely to argue that the study is flawed and that GMOs still pose a risk to human health and the environment.

            "question": "The freedom to study abroad has irrevocably transformed the landscape of higher education. It has become increasingly commonplace for students to spend a portion of their undergraduate time enrolled in foreign universities, living among locals, and exploring new cultures. According to a recent study by the Institute of International Education, over 332,000 American students studied abroad during the 2018\u20132019 academic year. This number has been steadily increasing since the 1980s. One of the major benefits cited by students who study abroad is the opportunity to gain a global perspective. By immersing themselves in a foreign culture, students develop a deeper understanding of different ways of life and become comfortable interacting with people from diverse backgrounds. This increased cultural sensitivity and adaptability can be invaluable in today's interconnected world.\n\nWhich choice most directly supports the claim that studying abroad is beneficial for students?",

            "explanation": "The buoyant force on the iceberg is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the submerged portion of the iceberg. The buoyant force is given by: F_b = \u03c1_w * V_s * g, where \u03c1_w is the density of the water, V_s is the volume of the submerged portion of the iceberg, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. The weight of the submerged portion of the iceberg is given by: F_g = \u03c1_i * V_s * g, where \u03c1_i is the density of the ice. Since the iceberg is floating, the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the submerged portion, so we have: F_b = F_g. This gives us: \u03c1_w * V_s * g = \u03c1_i * V_s * g. Dividing both sides by \u03c1_i * g, we get: V_s = \u03c1_w  \u03c1_i * V_s. Substituting the given values, we get: V_s = (1026 kgm^3)  (900 kgm^3) * V_s = 1.14 * V_s.

Jones also found that the Grand Canyon dinosaur shared a unique genetic mutation with the ancient dinosaur breeds of the African Islands in the Atlantic.

Text 1 indicates that Jones found a genetic mutation in North American dinosaurs from before the discovery of other dinosaur bones in the region and in African dinosaurs, which implies that dinosaurs were first brought to North America by African peoples. Text 2 explains that the genetic mutation Jones found is in dinosaurs from all over the world, thus undercutting the mutation as evidence of an African origin. However, Text 2 goes on to say \u201c[m]ore recently \u201d later explorers found multiple genetic markers shared by North American and African dinosaurs but \u201cthat other dinosaurs lack, \u201d which strongly suggests an African origin for the North American dinosaurs.

            "question": "The term \"allegory\" is commonly used to refer to a story that has a deeper meaning beyond its surface plot. In the novel *Animal Farm* by George Orwell, for example, the characters represent different political figures and ideologies, and the events of the story are a metaphor for the events of the Russian Revolution. Unlike other allegorical works, however, *Animal Farm* does not require readers to understand its deeper meaning in order to enjoy it. The story is compelling and engaging on its own terms, even if readers are not aware of the historical context that inspired it.\n\nWhat is one way in which *Animal Farm* differs from other allegorical works?",

Rising temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns are already affecting many ecosystems and communities around the world. The scientific community is largely in agreement that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, are a major contributing factor to these changes.\n\nOne of the most significant effects of climate change is the loss of biodiversity. As temperatures rise, many species are forced to migrate to new areas in order to survive. However, not all species are able to adapt to these changes, and some are at risk of extinction. Climate change is also affecting the distribution of diseases. As temperatures rise, mosquitoes and other disease-carrying insects are able to survive in new areas, increasing the risk of outbreaks.\n\nAccording to the passage, which of the following is NOT a major effect of climate change?",

The height and shape of a wave are influenced by a number of factors, including the wind speed, the distance the wind has traveled over water, and the depth of the water. The wind creates a disturbance in the water, and as the wind continues to blow, the disturbance grows into a wave. The height of a wave is determined by the speed of the wind. The faster the wind, the taller the waves. The shape of a wave is determined by the distance the wind has traveled over water. The longer the distance, the more time the wind has to shape the wave. The depth of the water also affects the shape of a wave.

However, sweating has a dual nature. This bodily function not only cools but also sends important chemical signals to other parts of the body. One such chemical signal, which the body produces in response to stress, helps fight infection and inflammation.

            "question": "In medieval Europe, the Church was a dominant force in every aspect of society, influencing not only religious matters but also politics, economics, and culture. However, over time, the Church's influence gradually declined, leading to the rise of secularism and the separation of church and state. In some countries, this process was marked by violent conflict, while in others it occurred more peacefully. The causes of the Church's decline are complex and varied, but some of the key factors include the rise of humanism, the Protestant Reformation, and the Scientific Revolution. For example, humanism emphasized the importance of reason and the individual, which led to a questioning of the Church's authority. The Protestant Reformation, on the other hand, challenged the Church's authority and promoted the idea of individual conscience. The Scientific Revolution also played a role by providing a new understanding of the world that did not rely on religious dogma.\n\nWhich of the following was a key factor that contributed to the decline of the Church's influence in medieval Europe?",

Harjo is described as refusing to follow the pattern of depicting Native characters in the distant past, not as proclaiming that pattern.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because the text describes television\u2019s tendency to represent Native characters in the distant past as something that is already occurring, not as something that Harjo \u201cforetells,\u201d or predicts will happen in the future. The text is focused on Harjo\u2019s \u201crejection\u201d of this pattern, not on any predictions he may have about it. Choice D is incorrect because saying that Harjo \u201crecants\u201d something would mean that he withdraws a previously held belief, and it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that Harjo recants television\u2019s tendency to represent Native characters as living in the past.

The light creates shadows of the puppets, which are then manipulated by puppeteers standing behind the screen. While shadow puppet plays had religious origins, they eventually evolved into a form of popular entertainment, often used to tell stories of Chinese history, folklore, and mythology. The craft of shadow puppetry has been passed down through generations of families, and a small number of them still practice this ancient art.\n\nWhat is the main idea of the passage?",

In fact, some artificial neural networks can even learn to learn faster as they gain more experience solving problems.\n\nWhich of the following is the author\u2019s main purpose in the passage?",

T o explain this, conservation scientist Erin Foster and colleagues compared the Vancouver Island meadows to meadows where otters are absent or were reintroduced only recently. Finding that the Vancouver Island meadows have a more diverse gene pool than the others do, Foster hypothesized that damage to eelgrass roots increases the plant\u2019s rate of sexual reproduction; this, in turn, boosts genetic diversity, which benefits the meadow\u2019s health overall.\n\nWhich finding, if true, would most directly undermine Foster\u2019s hypothesis?",

The text mentions a dialect of Spanish spoken in Texas, which was colonized by Spain in the 1500s. The text then states that the Texan dialect differs from other Spanish dialects in that it still has characteristics of an older Spanish that other dialects eventually lost. After asking why this might be, the text points out that the Texas colony was distant from Spain\u2019s other colonies, making it less attractive to colonists after the initial colonization. This geographic isolation limited the colony\u2019s exposure to other Spanish colonists who would have otherwise introduced the changes to the Spanish language that occurred in their respective colonies. It can therefore be inferred that this isolation is a reason why the Texan dialect still has characteristics of an older Spanish, while the Spanish dialects spoken in less isolated areas that have more interaction with speakers of other dialects would lose those characteristics over time. Thus, the most logical completion of the text is that fewer colonists were attracted to Texas after its initial colonization."

The words 'foreign' and 'domestic' do not make sense in this context because they would be referring to the location of the critics, which is not relevant. The words 'conservative' and 'liberal' do not make sense in this context because they would be referring to the political leanings of the critics, which is also not relevant. The words 'contemporary' and 'modern' are the best choice because they refer to the time period in which the critics lived, which is relevant to the context of the sentence."
