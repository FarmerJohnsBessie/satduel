However, those who date the poem to the late ninth through early eleventh centuries are prioritizing a controversial view of the social conditions at that time. The text makes no reference to any controversy about how scholars interpret that historical period. Instead, the text suggests that scholars who date the poem on the basis of its consistency with the historical context of England in the late ninth through early eleventh centuries have failed to account for linguistic evidence that the poem may have been composed earlier. Choice C is incorrect because the text says nothing about how well the poem fits the historical context of England in the seventh and eighth centuries, let alone that it fits that historical context as well as it fits the historical context of the late ninth through early eleventh centuries. Rather, the text says that there is linguistic evidence that the poem may have been composed in the seventh or eighth century.",

                "paragraph": "For centuries, the widespread acknowledgement of the cerebellum's role in motor control in humans has hindered recognition of its other possible functions. Neuroscience research from the last two decades suggests that the cerebellum also influences emotion and social behavior. Research by Ilaria Carta and colleagues has identified a pathway that connects the cerebellum to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a center for motivation and reward processing.",
                "explanation": "The passage states that the cerebellum was previously thought to only regulate motor functions, but recent research has shown that it also plays a role in emotion, social behavior, motivation, and reward processing.

A main clause requires a finite verb to perform the action of the subject (in this case, Ashford’s “gestures” and “habit”), and this choice supplies the finite past tense verb “helped” to indicate what Ashford’s gestures and habit helped accomplish.\nChoice B is incorrect because the non-finite participle “helping” doesn’t supply the main clause with a finite verb.

                "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text's discussion of scholars' understanding of Maya ecology and agricultural marketplaces. The text indicates that scholars used to believe that during the Classic period, the Maya civilization didn’t have agricultural marketplaces. According to the text, scholars held this view because they misunderstood the ecology of areas where the Maya lived. The text points out that people tend to create marketplaces in order to acquire resources they don’t otherwise control. Agricultural marketplaces would have allowed farmers who produced one type of crop to trade that crop for other types of crops that they didn’t produce. The text goes on to say, however, that scholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya areas, meaning that scholars thought that the Maya landscape produced a smaller range of resources than it actually produced. Taken together, then, this information suggests that scholars assumed that marketplaces wouldn’t have allowed Maya people to acquire products different from the products they already produced: that is, if everyone produced the same array of crops, as scholars mistakenly believed, then there wouldn’t have been any need for marketplaces where people could trade those crops.",

However, when they step back and listen to all the different recordings simultaneously, the result is a cacophony of sound. This cacophony of sound is meant to represent the diversity of the world’s population and to encourage people to think about the different cultures that exist in the world.",

A study led by Valerie P ayré focused on additional information—further analysis of data collected by the spacecraft and infrared wavelengths detected from Mars’s surface—that revealed the presence of surprisingly high concentrations of silica in certain regions on Mars. Since a planetary surface that formed in a mostly basaltic environment would be unlikely to contain large amounts of silica, P ayré concluded that ____",
